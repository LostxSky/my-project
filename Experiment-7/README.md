In this experiment I took my first step into React by building simple product cards with functional components, props, and JSX. Unlike earlier experiments where I was directly manipulating the DOM, here I let React handle rendering based on data. I created an App component with a small array of products and passed each object into a ProductCard. The card displayed the product name, price, and stock status, and would also show an image only if one was provided.
React started at main.jsx, mounted <App/> into the root, and then rendered each ProductCard. Since the data was static, nothing updated after the first render, but it showed me how React’s declarative style replaces the old manual “find and change” DOM approach. I also used quick inline styles to prototype the look of each card and kept the structure neat by separating main.jsx, App.jsx, and ProductCard.jsx.
Overall, this experiment introduced me to React’s component model and build tooling with Vite. It was a small project, but it marked a big shift in mindset: instead of changing the DOM step by step, I simply declared the UI as a function of my data, which sets the stage for mapping, state, and dynamic updates later.
