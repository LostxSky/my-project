First I made a HTML page and gave it the name Admin Dashboard.
Then I made a part called root where I put colors for normal mode like white, lightgreen, purple.
After that I made a rule that if I tick the dark mode box then colors change to black and dark grey.
I did not use any JavaScript, only HTML and CSS, so it is simple.

Then I Used HTML and body to take the whole screen so there is no empty space around.
I gave the body the background color and text color from my root, so they change when dark mode is on.
Then I made 4 big parts — header, nav, main, and footer — and gave all of them a black border so they are clearly visible.

In the header I put green color and some padding so it has space.
The nav is on the left side, I made it 200px wide and made it tall so it fills the screen height.
The main part is on the right side, I gave it space from the left so it does not cover nav and looks neat.
The footer is at the bottom with green color and text in center.

Then I made a checkbox at the top right for dark mode, and if I click it, the colors change without reloading.
The links in nav are purple so they look different from the rest of the text.
I also made sure that in dark mode the text, background, and even the links look good and readable.

At the end I put text in the main part saying “Welcome, Admin!” and a short paragraph,
and I wrote © 2025 Admin Panel in the footer.
Sometimes when I click dark mode, the text and background all change together,
and it still covers the full screen, so it works in both modes.
That’s how I made it first normal colors, then dark colors, then the layout,
and finally I added the dark mode switch without any JavaScript, and it all works with just HTML and CSS.
