First, I started the code with <!DOCTYPE html> and the <html> tag so the browser knows this is an HTML page.
Inside the <head> section, I gave the page a title using <title>Easy Draw</title>. This is the name that shows up on the browser tab.

Then, I moved to the <body> section where I placed everything the user can see.
I began with a heading <h2>SVG Drawing Tool</h2> so that the user knows this page is about drawing.

Next, I added a dropdown menu using the <select> tag with three <option> values: Line, Box, and Free Hand. This allows the user to pick what kind of shape they want to draw.

After that, I created a drawing area using <svg>. I gave it a width of 500, a height of 300, a black border, and a light gray background. This is like a canvas where the shapes will appear.

Finally, I wrote a <script> for the drawing actions.
Inside the script:

I first got the <svg> board and the tool (dropdown) so I can use them in the code.

When the mouse is pressed down (mousedown), the program checks what tool is selected and then creates that shape (a line, box, or freehand path) starting at the mouse position.

When the mouse moves (mousemove), the shape keeps updating to follow the cursor so it grows as the user drags. For example, a line extends, a rectangle gets bigger, and freehand keeps adding points.

When the mouse is released (mouseup), drawing stops.

This way, the page lets the user draw different shapes on the board by clicking and dragging.
